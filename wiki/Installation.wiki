#summary Basic Installation Instructions

=Dependencies =

You will need to download/install the netcdf toolbox which was originally written by Chuck Denham.  It still lives and functions with the Mathworks supplied mex-file interface (thanks to R. Signell for this info)

{{{
  svn co http://mexcdf.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mexcdf/mexnc/trunk
  svn co http://mexcdf.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mexcdf/snctools/trunk
  svn co http://mexcdf.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mexcdf/netcdf_toolbox/trunk
}}}

Make sure that "which mexnc"  returns an m-file, not a mex file.
